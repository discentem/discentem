[Nanomdmsandbox](https://github.com/discentem/nanomdmsandbox): a project that tries to make it easier to spin up a development/testing environment for [Nanomdm](https://github.com/micromdm/nanomdm). It definitely approaches something that could be production ready, but might require tweaks for your environment. To learn more, you can check out [this talk](https://github.com/radsec) that [@radsec](https://github.com/radsec) and I gave at MacDevOpsYVR22 about the project.
