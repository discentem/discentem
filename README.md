### Hi there, I'm BK ðŸ‘‹

I am a Client Platform Engineer managing macOS, Windows, and ChromeOS endpoints ðŸ’» 

I like to write golang, utilize configuration management, and contribute to open-source.

## Some of my recent projects...

### [Starcm](https://github.com/discentem/starcm)
"star-see-m"

A rudimentary configuration management language that utilizes Starlark instead of json or yaml.

### [Cavorite](https://github.com/discentem/cavorite)

A cli tool that makes it easy to track large, binary files in source control repositories by swapping the binary files with json metadata. Cavorite has support support for s3, Minio, Google Cloud Storage, and other artibrary storage systems through runtime plugins.

### [Nanomdmsandbox](https://github.com/discentem/nanomdmsandbox)

A project that makes it easy to spin up [Nanomdm](https://github.com/micromdm/nanomdm). To learn more, check out [this talk](https://github.com/radsec) that [@radsec](https://github.com/radsec) and I gave at MacDevOpsYVR22.

### [Getting started with Windows Imaging & Glazier (Part 1)](https://bkurtz.io/posts/glazier/)
