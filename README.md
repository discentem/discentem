### Hi there, I'm BK ðŸ‘‹

I am a Client Platform Engineer managing macOS, Windows, and ChromeOS endpoints ðŸ’» 

I like to write golang, utilize configuration management, and contribute open-source.

## Some of my recent projects...

### [Starcm](https://github.com/discentem/starcm)
"star-cm"

- A rudimentary configuration management language that utilizes Starlark instead of json or yaml.
- Why Starlark? It provides variables, functions, loops, and lots more "for free" inside of the configuration files!
- Starcm is not intended to be a full replacement for tools like Chef or Ansible, but starcm can be used to bootstrap these tools and many others through features like `exec()` for calling binaries, `template()` for rendering templated files, `load_dynamic()` for loading additional starcm config files dynamically, and much more!

### [Cavorite](https://github.com/discentem/cavorite)

A cli tool that makes it easy to track large, binary files in source control repositories by swapping the binary files with json metadata. Inspired by [pantri](https://github.com/facebook/IT-CPE/tree/main/pantri), Cavorite is a rewrite in Go with support for s3, Minio, Google Cloud Storage, and other storage systems through runtime plugins.

### [Nanomdmsandbox](https://github.com/discentem/nanomdmsandbox)

A project that makes it easy to spin up [Nanomdm](https://github.com/micromdm/nanomdm). To learn more, check out [this talk](https://github.com/radsec) that [@radsec](https://github.com/radsec) and I gave at MacDevOpsYVR22.

### [Getting started with Windows Imaging & Glazier (Part 1)](https://bkurtz.io/posts/glazier/) 

A repeatable way to create a WinPE ISO that supports [github.com/google/glazier](github.com/google/glazier).
